# ClangD Extension for [Nova][nova]

More information about the extension can be found in the
`ClangD.novaextension` directory.

This work builds on the an language server written by
Ben Beshara. Details are in the README for the extension.


## MOVED

We have moved this work into a non-forked repository called [**C-Dragon**][cdragon].
C-Dragon has had some improvements since we closed this.  If you're using the
extension in Nova, the extension name has not changed -- the repo move does not affect you.

(The reason for un-forking is that the new extension has been hugely refactored, and
adds a lot of work that Ben didn't do -- and it's unlikely that we would even desire
to try merge these changes into Ben's work.  We are however grateful Ben's original
work, which provided a nice foundation to build upon.)
