# ClangD Extension for [Nova][nova]

More information about the extension can be found in the
`ClangD.novaextension` directory.

This work builds on the an language server written by
Ben Beshara. Details are in the README for the extension.

## TODO:

- Automate installation of `xcode-select --install` (or make it a manual option).
- Provide ways to provide compile_flags.json
  - Perhaps offer typical cases - cmake, meson, bear, xcode?
- Enable use of CCLS instead of ClangD
- Rename this extension (and get a suitable logo)
- Add a sponsor button
- Consider C# support? Objective-C support? Probably not.
